# Fitness Tracker

## Description

This app is meant to serve as a budget tracker. It allows the user to add and subtract funds and give each transaction a name correlate with the transaction. The nice thing about this app is that it is a progressive web application, which means that the app is fully functional offline and it will link back to the app once an internet connection has been re-established.
